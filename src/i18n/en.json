		"frequency-hf-bands": "Usually operate on the following bands:",
		"frequency-hf-info-1": "You will often see me on FT8 frequencies of these bands, but also the SSB/CW frequencies on 40m/20m/15m/10m bands.",
		"frequency-hf-info-2": "Personally, I like CW more. You are welcome to contact me any time when you receive my call.",
		"frequency-hf-info-3": "If my callsign is attached with a <code>/QRP</code>, it means that I am using my QRP station with 5W power. QRP contact are challenging and it requires better propagation and antenna. Your QSO will be my best encouragement.",
		"frequency-hf-info-4": "<strong>Note:</strong> my callsign on your logbook shall be the same as what I send (i.e. <strong>DO NOT remove the prefixes or suffixes by yourself</strong>), otherwise the logs may not be able to be confirmed.",

		"frequency-vhf-6m-info-2": "By regulation, the maximum power limit on VHF is 25W. It is normal that you may find my signal strength not very strong.",
		"frequency-vhf-6m-info-3": "Similarly, you may meet me with <code>/QRP</code> suffix, which means I am using my QRP station.",
		"frequency-vhf-2m-info-1": "This is mainly for satellite communications. By regulation I am able to transmit on 146MHz-148MHz as well, but it is not for amateur satellites so I am not using this part very often.",
		"frequency-vhf-2m-info-2": "Right now I do not have any assistance for adjusting antenna azimuth, elevation, and Doppler. All of them are done manually. Usually I operates at ground level outdoors, focusing on FM because I am unable to bring many devices for digital satellites.",
		"frequency-vhf-2m-info-3": "Sometimes I will participate in communications via local repeaters, which will be logged on QRZ. If you need confirmation, remember to expand the \"Propagation\" section and select \"Terrestrial or atmospheric repeater or transponder\".",
