## QSL via QRZ.com
This is my preferred way to confirm QSOs. QRZ.com supports almost all fields in [ADIF Specifications](http://adif.org.uk/314/ADIF_314.htm#Fields) so it keeps every detail of a QSO.

Please kindly confirm our QSO on [QRZ Logbook](https://logbook.qrz.com/) if you have one.

## QSL via LoTW
As the most popular QSL platform, LoTW confirmation is also supported. Simply [upload your log with TQSL](https://lotw.arrl.org/lotw-help/submitting-qsos/) to do so.

::: tip
QRZ supports importing QSL confirmation from LoTW. I will do this regularly so that your confirmation will also be displayed on QRZ.

## Direct Mail
SASE is **NOT** required. I will try to pay the postage and reply every card received as soon as possible.

The mailbox is shared with others so please write [**my name**](https://www.qrz.com/db/BD4VQK) instead of my callsign as the recipient. Otherwise, the person responsible for receiving mails will get confused.
