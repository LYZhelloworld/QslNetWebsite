# Stations and Antennas

## Radio Stations

### Baofeng UV5R
My first radio station. It is a dual-band handheld transceiver with 5W output power. I purchased it to get my callsign for local communication.

### ICOM 7300
This is my first HF transceiver, a SDR radio with 100W power.

I use it for HF and 50MHz communication. Since it is European version, the 6m band is only 50 - 52MHz without the 52 - 54MHz segment.

It is mainly used for SSB, CW, FT8 modes.

### ICOM 705
A portable QRP radio with 5W power. Though the power is quite low, it is still able to make contacts with other stations.

It is easy to carry compared with ICOM 7300 which is heavier and larger. Moreover, it supports VHF and UHF bands with modes other than FM, which UV5R does not support. Sometimes 2m propagation is good and I can make contacts with other stations using FT8 mode.

This ICOM 705 is Japanese version so it does not support 146 - 148MHz segment on 2m band, as well as some segments between 1.8 - 2MHz and 3.5 - 3.9MHz.

## Antennas :signal_strength:

### BH2RSJ U2V2
A Yagi antenna designed and manufactured by BH2RSJ. It is a dual-band antenna with 2 elements on 2m band and 2 elements on 70cm band.

It was bought for satellite communication. Although I no longer use it for satellite, it is still a good antenna for local and 2m DX communication.

### DKGP10
An antenna designed by BG8GVJ. It can be set up outdoors vertically like a GP, or set up horizontally at the window of balcony.

It also provides a tuner instead of adjusting the length of the antenna. The tuner makes it able to work on all HF bands and 50MHz band.

### K8DX
The famous K8DX long wire antenna. During windy days, setting up DKGP10 may be dangerous, while K8DX is much safer.

Though setting up K8DX is more time-consuming, the noise is lower than GP and the signal is stonger.

K8DX also provides a tuner for different bands. It supports all HF bands and 50MHz band.
