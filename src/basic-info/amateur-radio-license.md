# Amateur Radio License

## License
* 6 Mar 2023: Class B license acquired.
* 25 Aug 2022: Class A license acquired.

I am able to operate on all amateur radio bands, with 100W power limit on HF, and 25W on VHF/UHF.

See [appendix](../appendices/crac-license-classes) for details about frequencies and power limits of different license classes.

## Activities

### Active Hours
Like most of the people working in the daytime, I am free only in the evening after work (about 19:00 to 22:00 UTC+8).

As for the weekend, you may see me on air at any time.

### Bands And Modes
CW and FT8 modes on 40M (7MHz) are preferred.

Please QRS on CW to about 20 WPM so that I can copy your message. I use a straight key at most of the time which cannot send very fast.

I am still practising CW. You can ask more questions during the QSO about NAME, QTH, RIG, ANT, PWR, WX, etc. and I will try to answer.
